##  Screenshots & User Workflow

The overall user experience of this platform is inspired by **Youtube**, following a complete workflow of  
**Registration & Login → Content Browsing → User Interaction → Personalized Recommendation**, forming a closed content loop.

---

###  User Registration & Login

<img src="login in.png" alt="Login" width="800"/>

- Users start by **registering or logging in** via a modal dialog
- After successful authentication, the backend issues a **JWT token**, which is centrally managed on the frontend
- Login status is required for:
  - Like / Coin / Collect actions
  - Following content creators
  - Posting comments and sending danmu
  - Collecting user behavior data for personalization

---

###  Homepage & Video Browsing

<img src="homepage.jpg" alt="Homepage" width="800"/>

- After login, users enter the homepage, whose layout is inspired by Youtube:
  - Top carousel for recommended or trending content
  - Category-based video feeds (Anime, Tech, Gaming, etc.)
- Users can continuously browse videos, while the system records key behavior signals:
  - Click events
  - Video playback
  - Watch duration

These data points are sent to the backend to support recommendation modeling.

---

###  Video Player & User Interaction

- A complete interaction system is provided:
  - 👍 Like
  - 🪙 Coin
  - ⭐ Collect
- **Real-time danmu (bullet comments)**:
  - Implemented using **WebSocket**
  - Precisely synchronized with the video timeline
- All interaction behaviors are logged as important features for personalized recommendations

---

### 💬 Comment System

- The comment system supports:
  - Top-level comments
  - Nested replies (threaded discussions)
- Users can reply to comments, enhancing community engagement
- Comment activity is also incorporated into user interest profiling

---

###  Personalized Recommendation

- Personalized recommendations are generated based on multiple user behavior signals, including:
  - Browsing and watch history
  - Likes / Coins / Collections
  - Follow relationships
  - Comment and danmu activity
- The backend recommendation service leverages **Redis** and **message queues** to handle high concurrency
- The frontend dynamically renders recommended video feeds, enabling:
  - A *“the more you watch, the better it gets”* experience
  - Recommendation behavior similar to **YouTube**

---

> This workflow forms a complete feedback loop:  
> **Login → Browse → Interact → Behavior Collection → Personalized Recommendation → Browse Again**
